# Ping CRM with Turso Database

> This is a forked repository of the original [Ping CRM](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm), a demo project showcasing Inertia.js with Laravel.

You can access this demo application online at [https://pingcrm.richan.id/](https://pingcrm.richan.id/).

This demo application illustrates how Laravel and Inertia.js work perfectly with the Turso database. The original Ping CRM uses an SQLite database, but this forked repository uses the Turso database.

This demo has adopted the [Turso Embedded Replica](https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-embedded-replicas-deploy-turso-anywhere-2085aa0dc242) feature, boosting the application's performance to be super fast! ðŸš€

The Turso database connection in this demo application is made possible by integrating the [Turso Database Driver for Laravel](https://github.com/richan-fongdasen/turso-laravel) package.

You can either obtain the Turso database credentials by following the [instructions here](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/http/quickstart) or use the Turso local development server as described in the [local development guide](https://docs.turso.tech/local-development#turso-cli). If you're using the local development server, set the `DB_URL` to `http://localhost:8080` and leave the `DB_ACCESS_TOKEN` empty.

```
DB_CONNECTION=turso
DB_URL=http://localhost:8080
DB_ACCESS_TOKEN=
DB_REPLICA=
DB_PREFIX=
DB_FOREIGN_KEYS=true
```
